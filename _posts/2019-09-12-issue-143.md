A lot of new hardware to talk and think about from Tuesday's Apple Event.
And a lot of new software to look forward to â€” which includes a whole lot of
the features the Swift team has been working on. I'm very much looking forward
to the new software in particular, and the app updates it will bring.

### News and community

The Gradle team [announced](https://blog.gradle.org/introducing-the-swift-plugins)
Swift support to compile, link and install applications and libraries, C++
interoperability, dependency management and more.

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN) shared [a document](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/CToSwiftNameTranslation.md)
explaining name translation from C to Swift.

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27033)
that directly leads to the elimination of over 400 lines of code from the
compiler. ðŸŽ‰

[Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/1130)
enabling the thread sanitizer for SwiftNIO, now that it works well enough on
Linux, thanks to [Julian Lettner](https://github.com/yln).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0263](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0263-string-uninitialized-initializer.md): *Add a String Initializer with Access to Uninitialized Storage* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0263-add-a-string-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-storage/27417).

> This proposal suggests a new initializer for `String` that provides access to
a String's uninitialized storage buffer.
>
> `String` today is well-suited to interoperability with raw memory buffers when
a contiguous buffer is already available, such as when dealing with `malloc`ed
C strings. However, there are quite a few situations where no such buffer is
available, requiring a temporary one to be allocated and copied into. One
example is bridging `NSString` to `String`, which currently uses standard
library internals to get good performance when using `CFStringGetBytes`.
Another, also from the standard library, is `Int` and `Float`, which currently
create temporary stack buffers and do extra copying. We expect libraries like
SwiftNIO will also find this useful for dealing with streaming data.

### Swift Forums

Davide Mendolia pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/generic-covariance-to-improve-api-usage/28719) 
to introduce generalized Generic Coveriance.

> As far as I know, only Arrays support Generic Covariance. Is it possible to
generalize it or to introduce in core elements like `Result` and allow libraries
like Combine to use it?

{% highlight swift %}
class Base {
}
class Derived: Base {
}

class ArrayBase {
    func foo(x: [Derived]) -> [Base] { return x }
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Would allow simplification of the following code instead of throwing errors
and require casting. Somethings that's already done today for `Optional`s and
`Array`.

{% highlight swift %}
class JustBase {
    func foo(x: Just<Derived>) -> Just<Base> { return x } // Compiler Error: Cannot convert return expression of type 'Just<Derived>' to return type 'Just<Base>'
}

class ResultBase {
    func foo(x: Result<Derived, Error>) -> Result<Base, Error> { return x } // Compiler Error: Cannot convert return expression of type 'Result<Derived, Error>' to return type 'Result<Base, Error>'
}
{% endhighlight %}

[Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) shared [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-mega-proposal/28547)
for Differentiable Programming.

> We have completed a comprehensive proposal for the differentiable programming
feature weâ€™ve been incubating over the last 1.5 years. Weâ€™ve gone over many
iterations on the feature design, and have partially completed the
implementation. Now we are ready to start a discussion on Swift Evolution,
specifically on upstreaming and standardizing the feature.
>
> Since this proposal is overly long (\~60 pages), we hope to start by merging
it into the `docs/` directory via [this pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27034),
and draft bite-sized proposals that contain references to the mega-proposal.

You can find the full proposal [here](https://github.com/dan-zheng/swift/blob/differentiable-programming/docs/DifferentiableProgramming.md).

[Gwynne Raskind](https://twitter.com/_AngeloidBeta)
pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/yet-another-varargs-splat-proposal/28649)
to support varargs "splat".

> Forwarding variadic arguments has come up fairly often in discussion, and I
thought I'd try my hand at working up a proposal, with a focus on arguments
against the oft-proposed "prefix operator" syntax.

You can find the full proposal [here](https://github.com/gwynne/swift-evolution/blob/splat-proposal/proposals/NNNN-forward-array-to-variadic-args.md).

[Owen Voorhees]() pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-extended-error-messages/28754)
to extend the capabilities of error messages.

> As a follow up from [Future of Diagnostics UX](https://forums.swift.org/t/future-of-diagnostics-ux/28178)
a couple weeks back, I wanted to further explore the idea of "extended
diagnostic messages" and see if they would be a good fit for Swift. What follows
is a rough pitch for what that might look like. I'm not sure if this will/should
result in an evolution proposal, but I think writing this up using the pitch
format makes it easy to evaluate and discuss alternatives.
>
> I'm interested in any and all feedback people have on whether they'd find
this useful! I'm especially interested in hearing from anyone who has worked
with Rust/Elm in the past and can comment on the benefits & drawbacks of their
approaches to diagnostics.

[Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss) shared [meeting notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/august-11th-2019/28553)
from the Swift on the Server Working Group that took place on August 8.

### Finally

[I know, I know...](https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1171794533140463617)
Still a good joke in my books.
