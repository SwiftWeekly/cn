It has at this point already been more than two and a half weeks since WWDC.
While many are looking into the new tech announced there, as well as playing
with the beta software, this is what has been going on in the Swift.org open
source projects over the last two weeks.

### News and community

[Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) shared that Swift for Tensorflow
[will be holding weekly open design meetings](https://twitter.com/bsaeta/status/1137014498995257344).

[Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss) shared the release of
[grpc-swift](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha.1),
the first Swift gRPC (Remote Procedure Calls) built on top of `SwiftNIOHTTP2`.

The second [Server Side Swift Conference](https://www.serversideswift.info/2019/)
will be held on October 30th and November 1st, 2019, in Copenhagen, Denmark.

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25449)
implementing composition of property wrappers.

[A pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25408) was merged that
makes Dictionaries to not be rewritten into a call expression after type
checking. The new way is to keep the `LiteralExpr` around and just stash a
reference to the right initializer.

[Davide Italiano](https://github.com/dcci) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb/pull/1693)
that fixes a bug by simply removing code!

[Owen Voorhees](https://twitter.com/owenvoorhees) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25510)
fully qualifies names for types with the same name in either different modules,
or different scopes. The diagnostic would be really confusing, and this change
improves that.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25615)
cleaning up the implementation of lazy property's underlying storage.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0258](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md): *Property Wrappers* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0258-property-wrappers-second-review/25843).

> Doug Gregor has provided the following list of differences from the previous
revision:
>
> - The name of the feature has been changed from "property delegates" to
"property wrappers" to better communicate how they work and avoid the existing
uses of the term "delegate" in the Apple developer community
> - When a property wrapper type has a no-parameter `init()`, properties that
use that wrapper type will be implicitly initialized via `init()`.
>  - Support for property wrapper composition has been added, using a "nesting"
model.
> - A property with a wrapper can no longer have an explicit get or set
declared, to match with the behavior of existing, similar features (`lazy`,
`@NSCopying`).
> - A property with a wrapper does not need to be `final`.
> - Reduced the visibility of the synthesized storage property to `private`.
> - When a wrapper type provides `wrapperValue`, the (computed) `$` variable is
internal (at most) and the backing storage variable gets the prefix `$$` (and
remains `private`).
> - Removed the restriction banning property wrappers from having names that
match the regular expression `_*[a-z].*`.
> - `Codable`, `Hashable`, and `Equatable` synthesis are now based on the
backing storage properties, which is a simpler model that gives more control to
the authors of property wrapper types.
> - Improved type inference for property wrapper types and clarified that the
type of the wrappedValue property is used as part of this inference. See the
"Type inference" section.
> - Renamed the value property to `wrappedValue` to avoid conflicts.
> - Initial values and explicitly-specified initializer arguments can both be
used together; see the `@Clamping` example.

An amendment for [SE-0240](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0240-ordered-collection-diffing.md): *Ordered Collection Diffing* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/amendment-se-0240-ordered-collection-diffing/26084).

> This amendment is to add a new method, `inverse()`, to the
`CollectionDifference` type.

> I was thinking about this a little bit and I actually think that there are
two additional motivating actions here we are not considering:

swift-syntax) that Swift's CMake builds on building the standard library.
>
> 2. CMake for free will let us integrate Swift code into swiftc itself
trivially.

[Ankit Aggarwal]() shared [that he has been working on test discovery on Linux](https://forums.swift.org/t/test-discovery-on-linux/26203).

> I've been slowly [working](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/2174)
on test discovery for Linux and I think the implementation is in a reasonable
state now. I've tested it on some OSS Swift packages but it would be great if
others can try it out and report any issues they run into. It can be enabled by
passing the `--enable-test-discovery` flag to the swift test invocation.

[Ian Partridge](https://twitter.com/alfa) shared [meeting notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/june-12th-2019/26023)
for the June 12th Swift Server Working Group meeting.

> Docker: Mishal joined to discuss publishing nightlies to Docker Hub. Happy to
scope out doing this - it would involve some infra work from Apple but in
principle happy to do this. We would prioritise Swift 5.1 convergence nightlies,
add `master` afterwards. Would prioritise having the latest build available,
historical builds can come later. Just full images, not slim.
>
> Ubuntu 14.04 update: there are still users although usage is believed to be
low. Mishal will check the stats. When we switch it off, we'll start with
`master`.
>
> Naming collisions: Johannes explained the current status, post discussions
around WWDC. There are a number of separate but related problems.

[Artem Redkin](https://twitter.com/artemredkin) created [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/feedback-nio-based-http-client/26149)
for an HTTP Client Library.

> There are a number of projects implemented their own HTTP client libraries.
This shows that there is a need for generic, multi-purpose, non-blocking,
asynchronous HTTP client library built on top of SwiftNIO. The Swift Server
Working Group aims to provide a number of packages that could be shared between
different projects, and I think the proposed HTTP client library would be a
good fit for those projects and other use-cases.
>
> Having one, community-driven project that can be shared between different
projects will hopefully solve the need to implement this functionality in every
project from scratch.

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) opened a discussion [to document
feature/syntax use and error/warning scenarios for proposals](https://forums.swift.org/t/additions-to-proposal-process-to-document-feature-syntax-use-and-error-warning-scenarios/26037).

> Since we already have ABI, API resilience and Source Compatibility sections
in the proposal template I think it might make sense to expand on that and make
sure that proposal is considering not only correct
syntax/use, but also accounts for (even if basic) scenarios when new
feature/syntax is used incorrectly or in an (temporary) unsupported way.
>
> I think it would make sense for proposals to state explicitly, in a separate
section, what is supported and what is not (listing possibilities for future
improvements), what is the possible initial set of diagnostic messages and some
basic error/warning scenarios as well as what are the ways current feature might
interact with other features already implemented in the language.
>
> New attributes/keywords could be a good example - it would be very helpful to
list contexts where new attribute/keyword could be used and what error message
should be used for the rest. What are the special cases and areas of the future
improvement e.g. currently could only be used on functions but later support
could be expanded to properties and subscripts. How does new attribute/keyword
interact with existing ones e.g. `@autoclosure` vs. `@escaping` or
`@autoclosure` vs. `inout`.
>
> I think having documentation like that in the proposal would make
implementation as well as code review much easier, and would be generally
helpful for posterity.

[Matthew Johnson](https://twitter.com/anandabits) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/move-swiftuis-identifiable-protocol-and-related-types-into-the-standard-library/25713)
to move SwiftUI's `Identifiable` protocol and related types to the standard
library.

> Swift UI introduces an `Identifiable` protocol as well as the related
`IdentifierValuePair` and `IdentifierValuePairs` types and the `identified(by:)`
method.
>
> I believe that `Identifiable` is a "currency" protocol with relevance to an
extremely broad range of Swift code and should therefore be moved into the
standard library along with the related types and method. These will be useful
to any generic code that works with values that represent a snapshot of the
state of an entity.

[Saleem Abdulrasool]() shared [there will be nightly builds](https://forums.swift.org/t/partial-nightlies-for-android-sdk/25909)
for the Android SDK.

> I've been working on getting nightlies of the Android SDK - the Swift
standard library, libdispatch (and swift SDK overlay), as well as libxml2 and
curl. Foundation is something which will take a bit more work, but is easily
added. These are not exactly perfect, but should get you fairly up-to-date
builds of the Swift standard library and libdispatch for the moment.
>
> All of these builds are being done on Windows, but the generated artifacts
are consumable on other targets as well (i.e. you can use this with an
up-to-date toolchain on Windows, Linux, or Darwin). They currently target
Android API level 21.
