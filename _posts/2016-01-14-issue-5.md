As you can see, the *weekly brief* has a new home! It feels much nicer to have a dedicated site rather than my [personal blog](http://www.jessesquires.com/new-weekly-brief/). I'm sure there are still some bugs lurking around, so if you find any or have suggestions for improvements to the site, please [open an issue]({{ site.links.issue }}) on GitHub!

### Commits and pull requests

Erik Little, Jesse Rusak, and Mike Ash discovered a [really cool bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-510). This compiles:

{% highlight swift %}

enum Testing: String {
    case Thing = "thing"
    case Bob = {!@#$!@#%!@} // lolwut
}

{% endhighlight %}

[Daniel Duan](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/931) and [Jesse Rusak](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/934) both attempted fixes. Perhaps Daniel's [currently open](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/955) pull request will get merged?

Jacob Bandes-Storch [fixed 4 compiler crashers](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/910) thanks to [@practicalswift](https://github.com/practicalswift)'s fuzzer. And then [8 more crashers, plus an IDE crasher](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/926). 😂

[@Atrick](https://github.com/atrick) fixed a [leak](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/9cf84c24ca860c64b6858d61d271476d5575592a) when interpolating optional references. ([SR-459](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-459))

Brian Gesiak's "testing the tests" [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/20) finally merged! He is now the [#1 contributor](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/graphs/contributors) to corelibs-xctest according to GitHub. 😦

### Proposals

Loïc Lecrenier's [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0011-replace-typealias-associated.md), *"Replace `typealias` keyword with `associatedtype` for associated type declarations"*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-January/000014.html) for Swift 2.2! Using `typealias` in protocols will be deprecated in 2.2 and removed from 3.0 entirely. It should be easy to migrate your existing code.

Doug Gregor [submitted a proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0022-objc-selectors.md), *"Referencing the Objective-C selector of a method"*. It's a dream come true. This has been a glaring issue from the beginning for interoperability with Objective-C. It looks like this feature can be added in Swift 2.2 and deprecate the use of string literals, after which 3.0 would remove the old syntax entirely.
>*"In Swift 2, Objective-C selectors are written as string literals (e.g., `"insertSubview:aboveSubview:"`) in the type context of a Selector. This proposal seeks to replace this error-prone approach with Selector initialization syntax that refers to a specific method via its Swift name."* 👏

David Farler's [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0020-if-swift-version.md), *"Swift Language Version Build Configuration"* is under review. *"Over time, Swift syntax may change but library and package authors will want their code to work with multiple versions of the language."* This proposal would allow programmatically checking the Swift version number, for example `#if swift(>=2.2)`. As a library author, I would welcome this feature!

### Mailing lists

After a ton of [discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160111/006466.html) on the mailing list (and [github](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/51) 😳), the [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0019-package-manager-testing.md) for testing support in the Swift Package Manager is moving back to "under revision" to incorporate even more feedback from the community.

Chris Hanson [started a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160104/006091.html) discussing adding XCTest support for Swift error handling. This would make `throws` a first-class citizen within XCTest, where it is currently a bit cumbersome and awkward to use. Remember [that time](https://www.natashatherobot.com/unit-testing-optionals-in-swift-xctassertnotnil/) when XCTest didn't really work with optionals? 😄

Drew Crawford [started a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20151228/000125.html) discussing how the Swift Package Manager could support third-party testing frameworks. I know a lot of developers in the community would love this, as it would allow using frameworks other than XCTest for testing.
