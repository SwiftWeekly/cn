This week brought us [Xcode 7.3 beta2](https://twitter.com/SwiftLang/status/691805674079195136) &mdash; the first official Xcode release that bundles Swift 2.2 *and* includes contributions from the Swift.org open source community! I never thought I would see [release notes](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.3_beta_2/Xcode_7.3_beta_2_Reease_Notes.pdf) like this.  It really is incredible to see community-driven changes in the *What's New* sections with links to GitHub. Clearly, the next big step for Apple should be open sourcing Xcode. 😉

### Repositories

Did you [notice](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/690342486917668864) the new [swift-integration-tests](https://github.com/apple/swift-integration-tests) repository on GitHub? According to the [history](https://github.com/apple/swift-integration-tests/commit/db437d2fa1951a9190b2c4adafffc701965ea8c4) it looks like this repo has been around since the initial open source announcement, but until now has been private. As you might guess, it includes tests. More specifically, *"Automated tests for validating the generated Swift snapshots behave correctly"*.

Slightly related, you may also have [noticed](https://twitter.com/simjp/status/692135037270134784) that there's [a new CI bot](https://github.com/swift-ci) in town. ([Seems legit](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/60114268.jpg))

But wait, there's more!

**Another** new repository appeared over the past week, [swift-internals](https://github.com/apple/swift-internals). It contains [this site](http://apple.github.io/swift-internals/). According to the welcome page, the site *"hosts internal documentation for the Swift compiler and standard library, as well as the development version of the Swift API Guidelines."*. 😦 Unfortunately, it only contains the API guidelines at the moment. Documentation for the Swift compiler sounds like it would be great for contributors. Also, does this mean [Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn) can shutdown [SwiftDoc.org](http://swiftdoc.org)? 😄

### Commits and pull requests

Doug Gregor [started](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ecfde0e71c61184989fde0f93f8d6b7f5375b99a) and [finished](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/c9c1d1390c621dc3932c0a77c8a191e6411b71f2) implementing proposal [SE-0021](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0021-generalized-naming.md), *"Naming Functions with Argument Labels"*.

Doug Gregor also implemented [SE-0022](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0022-objc-selectors.md), *"Referencing the Objective-C selector of a method"*. (Yes, it was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-January/000026.html).) No more *stringly-typed* Objective-C selectors! I enjoyed the [live](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/692480515534934017) [tweeting](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/692598054025715712) experience. 😂 You can check out the commits here: [dccf315](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/dccf3155f1fe5400df0c9b51f21a3b8f7fa09b9c), [7c0e087](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/7c0e087cd514c926d9eaa3082679edff626effc8), [89834f8](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/89834f8d5fcce652401ecaeec4addace48cb2fae), [f7407f6](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/f7407f6a4d2c9b20ef1d2aab6dbaff5f9419aa88).

Greg Titus [improved](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1042) quality of diagnoses messages, and has generally [been](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1069) [on a roll](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1089) with pull requests. 👏

Brian Gesiak submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/43) that implements the asynchronous testing API in corelibs-xctest. It mirrors the Objective-C XCTest API, adding the familiar methods `expectationWithDescription()` and `waitForExpectationsWithTimeout()`.

Nate Cook [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1063) an in-place merge sort to the standard library. From the description: *"This sort algorithm is both stable and offers a significant speed increase (1.5x-10x or more) in many common sorting scenarios."* 😎

William Dillon [added support](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/901) for ARMv6 (original Raspberry Pi) and fixed some ARMv7 bugs.

**@tinysun212** started a [port to cygwin](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1108).

Brian Croom submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/40) to corelibs-xctest to discuss compatibility between Darwin XCTest and corelibs-xctest.

### Proposals

Erica Sadun has [proposed](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/116/) to *"Eliminate Swift's Screaming Snake Case Identifiers"* and thus say goodbye to another vestige of C. ([Proposal here](https://github.com/erica/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/00xx-modernizing-debug-identifiers.md))
>This proposal aims to eliminate Swift's screaming snake case like `__FILE__` and `__FUNCTION__` and replacing instances with a common octothorpe-prefixed lower camel case `#sourceLocation` representation.

The proposal [SE-0013](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0013-remove-partial-application-super.md), *"Remove Partial Application of Non-Final Super Methods"*, has been [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-January/000022.html).

The following three proposals are now under review. These proposals are related and thus the reviews are running concurrently:

- [SE-0023](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0023-api-guidelines.md), *API Design Guidelines*
- [SE-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0006-apply-api-guidelines-to-the-standard-library.md), *Apply API Guidelines to the Standard Library*
- [SE-0005](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0005-objective-c-name-translation.md), *Better Translation of Objective-C APIs Into Swift*

### Mailing lists

Nicole Jacque [notes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160125/000934.html) that there is a new snapshot naming format. From now on, development version snapshots will begin with `swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT` to clearly distinguish between release snapshots.

Dmitri Gribenko [investigated and greatly reduced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160125/000943.html) `StdlibUnittest` build time. `StdlibUnittest` is an internal library that is used to write tests for the stdlib, parts of the runtime, and the compiler.
>But there is an issue: today, StdlibUnittest takes a long time to build. [...]
>
>These time measurements show that the build time of the combined module is
greater than the sum of the build times of the pieces, and much more so when
the optimization is turned on.  We can make a conjecture that the optimizer is
not scaling well with the module size.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; if you feel like Swift is changing too fast or if you are simply interested in trying something new, may I suggest [TrumpScript](https://github.com/samshadwell/TrumpScript)? 😂 Let's make programming great again.™
