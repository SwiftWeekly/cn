While I have the feeling I've had a busy two weeks, it seems like I haven't
been the only one...

### Commits and pull requests

[David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26630)

[Michael Gottessmann](https://twitter.com/gottesmang) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26956)

benchmark now runs in half the time! 😱🏎

### Returned proposals

[SE-0262](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0262-demangle.md): *Demangle Function* was [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0262-demangle-function/28186).

> The core team supports having standardized functionality for turning a Swift
symbol name into a human-readable string for logging, debugging, and crash
reporting purposes. However, many important design points were raised in the
review of SE-0262, and so we are returning the proposal for revision.

### Rejected proposals

[SE-0042](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0042-flatten-method-types.md): *Flattening the function type of unapplied method references* was [rejected](https://forums.swift.org/t/formally-revoking-se-0042/28174).

> SE-0042 was formally [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0042-flattening-the-function-type-of-unapplied-method-references/1926)
more than three years ago. However, since the proposal was accepted before
having a working implementation was a requirement, and the change would be
source breaking, and also require massive rewrites of the compiler; it is now
clear that this proposal will never actually be implemented. It has been obvious
for a long time.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0263](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0263-string-uninitialized-initializer.md): *Add a String Initializer with Access to Uninitialized Storage* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0263-add-a-string-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-storage/27417).

> This proposal suggests a new initializer for `String` that provides access to
a String's uninitialized storage buffer.
>
> `String` today is well-suited to interoperability with raw memory buffers
when a contiguous buffer is already available, such as when dealing with
`malloc`ed C strings. However, there are quite a few situations where no such
buffer is available, requiring a temporary one to be allocated and copied into.
One example is bridging `NSString` to `String`, which currently uses standard
library internals to get good performance when using `CFStringGetBytes`.
Another, also from the standard library, is `Int` and `Float`, which currently
create temporary stack buffers and do extra copying. We expect libraries like
SwiftNIO will also find this useful for dealing with streaming data.

### Swift Forums

[Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/Ilseman) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/offset-indexing-and-slicing/28333) improving Offset Indexing and Slicing.

> This pitch introduces `OffsetBound`, which can represent a position in a
collection specified as an offset from either the start or end of the collection
(i.e. the collection’s “bounds”). This covers an expressivity gap in collection
APIs by providing easy and safe means to fetch an index or element from such an
offset as well as convenient slicing.

> If you would like to try it out, you can just copy-paste from
[this gist](https://gist.github.com/milseman/1461e4f3e195974a5d1ad76cefdd6961),
which includes the functionality as well as test cases and examples.

[Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) proposed [adding "does `X` conform to `Y`?"](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-a-does-x-conform-to-y-request/28349)
to the request evaluator.

> I wonder if there are plans to add a "does X conform to Y" request to the
[request evaluator](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/tensorflow/docs/RequestEvaluator.md) system (or other ways to unify conformance lookup logic)?
>
> I'm curious because there multiple ways to perform conformance lookup (and
find associated type witnesses), some of which have caused bugs for the
[differentiable programming project](https://forums.swift.org/t/pre-pitch-swift-differentiable-programming-design-overview/25992), which needs `Differentiable` conformance
lookup and associated type witness lookup during Sema, SILGen, and SIL
transforms.
>
> In my experience, the static function `TypeChecker::conformsToProtocol` has
been the most reliable way of obtaining a conformance (over
`ModuleDecl::lookupConformance` and `ModuleDecl::conformsToProtocol`), but it
is available only during Sema, not during SIL.

[Owen Voorhees](https://twitter.com/owenvoorhees) shared some thoughts [on the future of the Diagnostics User Experience](https://forums.swift.org/t/future-of-diagnostics-ux/28178).

> Lately, I've been thinking about how the diagnostics user experience for Swift
could be improved in the long term. I thought it would be valuable to start a
conversation around what kind of improvements people would like to see and what
we can learn from other compilers, maybe resulting in some kind of rough
roadmap if there's enough interest.

[Giuseppe Lanza](https://twitter.com/GLDeveloper) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/allowing-explicit-escaping-for-optional-closures-in-function-parameters/28334)
allowing explicit `@escaping` for optional closures in function parameters.

>> A closure is said to escape a function when the closure is passed as an argument 
>> to the function, but is called after the function returns . When you declare a 
>> function that takes a closure as one of its parameters, you can write @escaping 
>> before the parameter’s type to indicate that the closure is allowed to escape.
>
> Quote from the [Swift documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html)
>
> This statement is not always true when considering optional closures passed
as function parameters.
>
> This proposal aims to uniform the behaviour of optional closures with the
well-known behaviour of  non-optional closures when passed as function
parameters.
