Swift 2.2 has been [released](https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-released/)! It includes contributions from 212 non-Apple contributors and 7 Swift evolution proposals. Be sure to read Ted Kremenek's [announcement](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000071.html) on the mailing list for more details. The final version of [Xcode 7.3](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/xc7_release_notes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001051-CH5-DontLinkElementID_29) was also released, which includes Swift 2.2 and other [improvements](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/711972673367052288). Hopefully you were able to upgrade [successfully](https://twitter.com/ericasadun/status/712036220818350081). 😅

Regarding new features, I agree with [Ayaka](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon/status/712076521368739840) that having non-stringly-typed Objective-C selectors is so great. And of course, there were a number of interesting announcements at Apple's [special event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/) on Monday. [This](https://twitter.com/stringcode/status/711963672243994625) was my favorite new product. 😄

Lastly, in case you [missed it](https://twitter.com/swiftlybrief/status/711297027276038144), there's now an official mailing list for *Swift Weekly Brief*! [Subscribe now](/subscribe/). 💌

### Starter tasks

- [SR-1020](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1020): Fix-it Delete “var” doesn't delete space before parameter name
- [SR-873](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-873): Python Benchmark Driver needs unit tests
- [SR-804](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-804): Improve SwiftPM Testing Time

Suggestions from [Brian Gesiak](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/swiftweekly.github.io/issues/28):

- [SR-1046](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1046): Make sure we use the same test runner executable for both the Swift and swift-corelibs-xctest builds.
- [SR-1047](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1047): Test the Python used in the swift-corelibs-xctest project as part of the XCTest test suite.

### Commits and pull requests

I noticed that [**@swift-ci**](https://github.com/swift-ci) expanded its repertoire recently. When [first announced](https://swift.org/blog/swift-ci/), the core team could trigger running the full test suite by commenting "__@swift-ci__ Please test" on pull requests. Now, commenting "__@swift-ci__ Please [smoke test](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1750#issuecomment-199074599)" will only build the target projects to make sure they build successfully. **@swift-ci** can also merge with "__@swift-ci__ Please [test and merge](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1764#issuecomment-200186354)". Even more, there's "__@swift-ci__ Please [perf test](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1682#issuecomment-199569395)" which will run performance tests and then [leave a comment](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1682#issuecomment-199628576) noting any regressions, improvements, and unchanged results for both `-O` and `-Onone` optimization levels. 😎 If only we could say, [please fix](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1740#issuecomment-198777108)... 😂

Shawn Erickson submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1731) to unify mutexes in the Swift runtime, resolving [SR-946](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-946).

Daniel Eggert [started work](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/299) on implementing `NSURLSession`. It's implemented using `libcurl` and currently a work-in-progress. 👏

Jesse Rusak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1732) that implements proposal [SE-0037](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0037-clarify-comments-and-operators.md): *Clarify interaction between comments & operators*. This proposal was accepted as a bug, and resolves [SR-186](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-186) and [SR-960](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-960).

Taylor Franklin [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/288) the remaining `NSDateFormatter` attributes and added more tests, resolving [SR-208](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-208).

Ian Partridge submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/291) that implements `NSJSONSerialization.dataWithJSONObject(_:options:)`.

Slava Pestov [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ebb8d7392c8f3da07bb299ed0d6a240c0eb07a49) leaking the error value when using `try?`, resolving [SR-972](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-972).

David Grove of IBM opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/61) to rework the corelibs-libdispatch overlay for Linux. It resolves [SR-739](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-739), [SR-740](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-740), [SR-737](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-737). *"This commit fixes all of these issues by injecting a complete Swift overlay layer that wraps the native libdispatch objects and native APIs."*

Yan Li submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/297) that implements the basic initializers for `NSAttributedString`.

Arnold Schwaighofer opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1797) to make `String`'s comparison and hash function faster on platforms that use Objective-C inter-op by using a stack allocated `_NSContiguousString`. The change provides a 1.2x to 2.2x speedup. 😎

Arsen Gasparyan [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1761) a patch that replaced `if true { }` with `do { }` in some test files. Odd. 🤔 My guess is that these tests predated the introduction of `do { }`? In any case, consider this your occasional reminder that there are always opportunities for small, easy wins like code cleanup. Get involved!

Another interesting thing I noticed was in Neil Kimmett's [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1323) to add `.zero` convenience static vars for `UIEdgeInsets` and `UIOffset`. This required internal discussion with the UIKit team to [get approval](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1323#issuecomment-199417826) for the change. 😳

### Proposals

Andrew Bennett's proposal, [SE-0043](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0043-declare-variables-in-case-labels-with-multiple-patterns.md): *Declare variables in `case` labels with multiple patterns*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000073.html) **for Swift 3**. *"This is a simple and clean extension to the pattern matching model in Swift, positively received by both the community at large and the core team."* Greg Titus has [already implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1383) the change on master! 👏

Joe Groff's proposal, [SE-0042](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0042-flatten-method-types.md): *Flattening the function type of unapplied method references*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000074.html) **for Swift 3**. *"The core team and most of the community agree that this proposal would increase the usability of the functional features in Swift, and eliminates a class of problems that occur with `inout` parameters."* This work is being tracked at [SR-1051](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1051).

Adrian Kashivskyy's and Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0047](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0047-nonvoid-warn.md): *Defaulting non-Void functions so they warn on unused results*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000075.html) *with revision* **for Swift 3**. This work is being tracked at [SR-1052](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1052).

>The core team and much of the community agree that this proposal directly aligns with the spirit of the Swift language, making it so that the compiler will warn about obvious omissions in code that may be bugs. The `@discardableResult` attribute provides a good way for API authors to indicate that their functions and methods produce a non-essential result, and should not produce this warning. [...]
>
>While this seems like a great direction for the standard library and other pure-Swift code, its impact on imported C and Objective-C APIs is less clear. [...] As such, the core team requests that this proposal be revised to indicate that the Clang importer will automatically add the `@discardableResult` attribute to all non-Void imported declarations...

Michael Ilseman's proposal, [SE-0044](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0044-import-as-member.md): *Import as member*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000076.html), though the version of Swift is not specified. *"While there wasn't a huge amount of feedback, all of the feedback received was positive. During the review period, the proposal was amended to support mapping getter/setter functions to subscripts (via the swift_name attribute) and to support importing instance members into an extension of an Objective-C protocol."* Work for this is happening on the [import-as-member](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/import-as-member) branch.

Michael Buckley's proposal, [SE-0016](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0016-initializers-for-converting-unsafe-pointers-to-ints.md): *Add initializers to `Int` and `UInt` to convert from `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer`*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000072.html). From the introduction: *"Just as users can create `Unsafe[Mutable]Pointers` from `Int`s and `UInt`s, they should be able to create `Int`s and `UInt`s from `Unsafe[Mutable]Pointers`. This will allow users to call C functions with `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t` parameters, and will allow users to perform more advanced pointer arithmetic than is allowed by UnsafePointers."* It seems like a rather straightforward API change that will improve inter-op with C. There isn't much feedback on the mailing lists, but so far it's positive.

Chris Willmore has prepared a proposal, [SE-0054](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0054-abolish-iuo.md): *Abolish `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` type*, after [discussions](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012752.html) on the mailing lists. There was mixed feedback during the drafting process and the status of the proposal is now **awaiting review**.

>The `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` (`IUO`) type is a valuable tool for importing Objective-C APIs where the nullability of a parameter or return type is unspecified. It also represents a convenient mechanism for working through definite initialization problems in initializers. However, `IUO`s are a transitional technology...
>
>This proposal seeks to limit the adoption of `IUO`s to places where they are actually required, and put the Swift language on the path to removing implicitly unwrapped optionals from the system entirely when other technologies render them unnecessary.

Nicholas Maccharoli has prepared a proposal, [SE-0053](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0053-remove-let-from-function-parameters.md#remove-explicit-use-of-let-from-function-parameters): *Remove explicit use of `let` from Function Parameters*, after [discussions](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012851.html) on the mailing lists. *"Since function parameters are immutable by default, allowing function parameters to be explicitly labeled as `let` is a bit of a syntactic redundancy that would best be removed."* Feedback on the lists is positive. I'm surprised Erica Sadun didn't think of this first. 😉

Patrick Pijnappel not only prepared a proposal, [SE-0052](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0052-iterator-post-nil-guarantee.md): *Change `IteratorType` post-nil guarantee*, but already submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1702) for the change. 👏 *"Currently, the documentation for `IteratorType.next()` has the precondition that when calling `next()`, no preceding call to `next()` should have returned `nil`, and in fact encourages implementations to raise a `preconditionFailure()` for violations of this requirement. However, all current 27 `IteratorType` implementations in the standard library return `nil` indefinitely."* His proposed solution is to bring the guarantee in line with the common expectation, and require iterators to return `nil` indefinitely.

### Mailing lists

Timothy Wood [started a discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/013054.html) about updating the signature of the `ObjectiveC.autoreleasepool` function to add `rethrows` ([SR-842](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-842)), and [drafted](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/221) a proposal. *"The `autoreleasepool` function in the standard library does not currently support a return value or error handling, making it difficult and error-prone to pass results or errors from the body to the calling context."*

Chris Lattner [started a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012604.html) to revive discussions on proposal [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md): *Scoped Access Level*.

>To summarize the place we’d like to end up:
>
>- “public” -> symbol visible outside the current module.
>- “internal” -> symbol visible within the current module.
>- unknown -> symbol visible within the current file.
>- “private” -> symbol visible within the current declaration (class, extension, etc).
>
>The rationale here is that this aligns Swift with common art seen in other languages, and that many people using private today don’t *want* visibility out of their current declaration.  It also encourages “extension oriented programming”, at least it will when some of the other restrictions on extensions are lifted.  We discussed dropping the third one entirely, but think it *is* a useful and important level of access control, and when/if we ever get the ability to write unit tests inside of the file that defines the functionality, they will be a nicer solution to `@testable`.
>
> The thing we need to know is what the spelling should be for the third one...

As you can imagine, an explicit request for bikeshedding has resulted in a tremendous thread. It looks like the consensus so far is for `private`, `private(module)`, `private(file)` &mdash; which [James Berry](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012609.html) suggested. I think this is great. 👍 Shawn Erickson [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012635.html) that this puts the current `private(set)` in an awkward position, but it's [always been weird](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012639.html) anyway.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; from now on, we shall refer to "compiler bugs" as [not-yet-implemented features](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013095.html). 😄 Feel free to assign any tasks to Dave Abrahams. 😉
