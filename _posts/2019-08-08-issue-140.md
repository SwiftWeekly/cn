### Starter tasks

- [SR-11198](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11198) [Compiler] Compiler crash on `inout`-to-pointer used with `@autoclosure` param returning optional
- [SR-11261](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11261) [Compiler] Parser recovery for keyword after `case` declaration

### Podcasts

In the latest Swift Community Podcast, [Kateryna](https://twitter.com/gridnaka), [Paul](https://twitter.com/twostraws), [Erica](https://twitter.com/ericasadun), and [John](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) talk about [their first impressions](https://www.swiftcommunitypodcast.org/episodes/6) on SwiftUI.

In the latest Swift Unwrapped episode, [Jesse](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires) and [JP](https://twitter.com/simjp) discuss [Generic Math Functions and Approximate Equality](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/305700).

### News and community

[Dave Verwer](https://twitter.com/daveverwer) announced [The SwiftPM Library](https://daveverwer.com/blog/launching-the-swiftpm-library/), a Swift Package Manager search engine.

In lights of the Combine release, [Jasdev Singh](https://twitter.com/jasdev) wrote [a post](https://jasdev.me/duals) explaining reactive and imperative programming.

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26369) that "fixes a glaring algorithmic problem in code [he] wrote *checks notes* six years ago". ðŸ˜…

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26356) that gets them closer to having local variables with `lazy` and property wrappers.

[Andrew Trick](https://github.com/atrick) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26440) where exclusivity enforcement is not just about safety - it also enables better optimizations.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0261](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0261-identifiable.md): *Identifiable Protocol* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0261-identifiable-protocol/27358).

> The proposal was positively received as addressing a common need for which a standard protocol is appropriate.
>
> During review, there were some concerns about the use of the property `id`, with some preferring `identifier` to avoid clashes with existing properties, while others stated they would have the same problem with `id`. The core team feels that id, as the term of art, is the better choice. Future [language features](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0261-identifiable-protocol/26602/166) should provide a path to resolve clashes.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0263](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0263-string-uninitialized-initializer.md): *Add a String Initializer with Access to Uninitialized Storage* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0263-add-a-string-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-storage/27417).

> This proposal suggests a new initializer for `String` that provides access to a String's uninitialized storage buffer.
>
> `String` today is well-suited to interoperability with raw memory buffers when a contiguous buffer is already available, such as when dealing with `malloc`ed C strings. However, there are quite a few situations where no such buffer is available, requiring a temporary one to be allocated and copied into. One example is bridging `NSString` to `String`, which currently uses standard library internals to get good performance when using `CFStringGetBytes`. Another, also from the standard library, is `Int` and `Float`, which currently create temporary stack buffers and do extra copying. We expect libraries like SwiftNIO will also find this useful for dealing with streaming data.

### Swift Forums

[Dean Harel](https://github.com/deanha) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-dedicated-function-for-evaluating-void-returning-closures-when-optional-instance-is-not-nil/27367) for a dedicated function for evaluating `Void` returning closures when an `Optional` instance is not `nil`.

> A transformation of the shape, one that returns nothing, is not uncommon in our day-to-day tasks, and in my opinion deserves a name which clearly and conspicuously translates the writer's intent in call-site.
>
> In this respect, another Container type in Swift that has been added a dedicated method to handle such "transformations" is the Array type. Consider the following functions:

{% highlight swift %}
func map<T>(_ transform: (Element) throws -> T) rethrows -> [T]
func forEach(_ body: (Element) throws -> Void) rethrows
{% endhighlight %}

> While we would all agree that `forEach(_:)` is not a necessity, we can also agree that for the task of printing all elements in an array, this:

{% highlight swift %}
[4, 2].forEach { print($0) }
{% endhighlight %}

> reads much nicer than this:

{% highlight swift %}
_ = [4, 2].map { print($0) }
{% endhighlight %}

Thus I propose adding a parallel function to `Array`'s `forEach(_:)`, taking advantage of a similar naming for convenience:

{% highlight swift %}
public extension Optional {
    func forValue(_ body: (Wrapped) throws -> Void) rethrows {
        guard let value = self else { return }
        try body(value)
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

[Giuseppe Lanza](https://twitter.com/GLDeveloper) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-unrequired-in-function-signature-for-optional-closure-parameters/27577) to support `@unrequired` in function signatures for optional closure parameters.

> From a perspective of a framework writer it is important to provide clear and understandable documentation for the correct usage of their APIs. Swift allows us to write functions that are at some extent self documenting, and clearly define what the function will actually do.

[Franz Busch](https://twitter.com/FranzJBusch) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-support-for-binary-dependencies/27620) to add support for binary dependencies in the Swift Package Manager.

> This draft introduces support for binary dependencies in SwiftPM. It will allow vendors to upload artifacts for all supported platforms which will be resolved, downloaded and linked by SwiftPM. There are still some open things left, which can be found at the bottom, but we wanted to get community feedback before we continue with this.
