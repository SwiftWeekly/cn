This week the third beta of Xcode 9 (and thus Swift 4) was released, there are a couple of new proposals in review, and the IBM Runtimes compiler team announced a prototype JIT compiler for server-side Swift, which will be open sourced in the near future. This is super cool, but if I'm being honest I'm more excited about the potential enhancements to multi-line string literals. ðŸ˜„

In other news, there are currently [15 accepted proposals](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) for Swift 4 that have not been implemented. I'm sure many are in-progress, but it looks likely that some of these will be pushed to a future release.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-5337](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5337): Improve diagnostic for `var` in parameter position
- [SR-5383](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5383): Display appropriate message when trying to build system module packages
- [SR-5324](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5324): Better diagnostic when instance member of outer type is referenced from nested type

### Swift Unwrapped

In Episode 19: [WWDC Reactions](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped), we share our thoughts on the announcements and events from the week. Better late than never! Listen to find out why we had to wait so long. ðŸ˜„

### News and community

New betas of Xcode 9 and Swift 4, and all the platform OSes are [now available](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=07102017a).

Some [updates to the CODE_OWNERS.txt](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6874/files) were made, so take note for when you need to find the right person to review your pull requests. Of note, Chris Lattner is still listed as being responsible for "everything in Swift not covered by someone else" &mdash; good thing he's [currently unemployed](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/877341760812232704)! ðŸ˜‰

### Commits and pull requests

Arjun Nayini [merged changes](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/8354) to the stdlib to make 0-ary tuples (that is, `()`) conform to `Equatable`. ([SR-4172](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4172)) Rejoice, `() == ()` will now compile. And it only took 3.5 months! ðŸ˜… Luckily, it [*did not*](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170710/038032.html) require a formal swift-evolution review.

John Holdsworth opened two pull requests ([#1103](), [#1113](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/1113)) for corelibs-foundation to get https working on Android.

Jordan Rose [made changes](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10928) to the ClangImporter to prevent importing compatibility methods named `print` because they make things harder for people trying to use `Swift.print`. Amen. ðŸ™Œ

As part of [SE-0157](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0157-recursive-protocol-constraints.md), Doug Gregor [added a new frontend flag](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10916), `-enable-recursive-constraints`. *"Introduce `-enable-recursive-constraints` to disable the error about direct recursion within a protocol definition. The implementation of recursive protocol constraints is incomplete, but might be useful for experimentation."*

Ankit Aggarwal [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1264) to implement [SE-0181](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0181-package-manager-cpp-language-version.md). (See below for details.)

Philippe Hausler [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10914) benchmarks for common `NSString` APIs that are exposed on `String`.

Bartek Chlebek [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/1101) `OperationQueue.current` in corelibs-foundation.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md): *String Index Overhaul* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170703/037942.html).

> The proposal is accepted. There was a lively discussion about it, but in the end everyone seems to agree that this is the right thing to do.
>
> As always, I'd like to thank you for your help in making Swift a better language.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0181](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0181-package-manager-cpp-language-version.md): *Package Manager C/C++ Language Standard Support* by Ankit Aggarwal is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-July/000389.html).

> This proposal adds support for declaring the language standard for C and C++ targets in a SwiftPM package.
>
> The C++ language standard is one of the most important build setting needed to compile C++ targets. We want to add some mechanism to declare it until we get the complete build settings feature, which is deferred from the Swift 4 release.
>
> [...]

[SE-0182](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0182-newline-escape-in-strings.md): *String Newline Escaping* by John Holdsworth, David Hart, and Adrian Zubarev is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-July/000390.html).

> This proposal is a refinement of [SE-0168](0168-multi-line-string-literals.md) which introduces the ability to escape newlines in single and multi-line strings to improve readability and maintenance of source material containing excessively long lines.
>
> Swift-evolution thread: [Discussion thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170417/035923.html)
>
> Escaping newlines in multi-line strings was removed from the [SE-0168](0168-multi-line-string-literals.md) proposal by the Core Team [...]
>
> Adding them to multi-line strings would have introduced an inconsistency with respect to conventional string literals. This proposal conforms both multi-line and conventional string construction to allow newline escaping, enabling developers to split text over multiple source lines without introducing new line breaks. This approach enhances source legibility. [...] Incorporating a string continuation character is well founded, used in other development languages, and carries little risk of confusing naive users.


### Mailing lists

Younes Manton [sent an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170710/037970.html) announcing a prototype JIT compiler for server-side Swift, created by a small group of developers from the IBM Runtimes compiler team:

> Last year a small group of developers from the IBM Runtimes compiler team
undertook a project to explore JIT compilation for Swift, primarily aimed
at server-side Swift. The compilation model we settled on was a hybrid
approach that combined static compilation via `swiftc` with dynamic
compilation via a prototype JIT compiler based on Eclipse OMR. [1]
>
> This prototype JIT compiler (targeting Linux specifically) functioned by
having itself loaded by a Swift process at runtime, patching Swift
functions so that they may be intercepted, recompiling them from their SIL
representations, and redirecting callers to the JIT compiled version. In
order to accomplish this we needed to make some changes to the static
compiler and the target program's build process.
>
> [...]
>
> (As for the prototype itself, we intend to open source it either in its
current state [based on Swift 3.0 and an early version of OMR] or in a more
up-to-date state in the very near future.)
