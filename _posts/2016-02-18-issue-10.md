Welcome to issue #10 of the weekly brief! This week Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi appeared on [The Talk Show](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2016/02/12/ep-146) with John Gruber. There wasn't much talk about Swift, but they did discuss plenty of interesting things. I highly recommend listening, especially if you are an iOS developer! üì±

### Commits and pull requests

Joe Groff [began work](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1297) on the initial parsing and synthesis for properties with behaviors for proposal [SE-0030](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md). üëè

Janek Spaderna [fixed a bug](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1302) in the AST that prevented you from accessing associated types through class-constrained generic parameters. [SR-726](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-726) has more details.

William Dillon submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-clang/pull/8) that enables `CF_ENUM` and `CF_OPTIONS` on non-Darwin targets.

Max Howell [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/commit/a25ba1c21a449cae4b683a4d463fc021c2f97576) the SPM `testing` branch into `master`, completing proposal [SE-0019](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0019-package-manager-testing.md). üôå

Brian Gesiak submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1316) to allow corelibs-xctest to be built and tested on Linux and OS X. Finally testing the tests! üòÑ

Manav Gabhawala [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/137) the `dataWithJSONObject(_: options:)` API in corelibs-foundation.

Nate Cook [improved](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1327) the stdLib documentation for Swift 2.2. üéâ This should be no surprise coming from the creator of [swiftdoc.org](http://swiftdoc.org).

Doug Gregor [fixed rdar://24575507](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1330). This bug prevented a type from satisfying a protocol with initializers if an `init()` was defined in a protocol extension instead of a concrete class or struct.

Two weeks ago, I linked to William Dillon's [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1157) for gold linker. After [a lot of discussion](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1157#issuecomment-185801246), this week it was finally merged!

### Proposals

The review of Joe Groff's proposal on property behaviors ([SE-0030](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md)) has been [extended for another week](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000038.html).

Daniel Dunbar's proposal, *Package Manager C Language Target Support* ([SE-0038](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0038-swiftpm-c-language-targets.md)), is now under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160215/000261.html). There isn't much feedback yet, but this would be a great addition!

Zachary Waldowski's proposal, *Expose code unit initializers on String* ([SE-0027](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0027-string-from-code-units.md)), is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000036.html). The proposal suggests exposing  private `String` APIs as public to improve working with byte representations and unicode.

James Campbell's proposal, *Optional Value Setter `??=`* ([SE-0024](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0024-optional-value-setter.md)), is also under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000037.html). He suggests adding a new operator, `??=`. *"If the optional is set via this operator then the new value is only set if there isn't an already existing value."* Support for this was mixed. [Greg Titus](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151214/002633.html) didn't see the value in an extra operator. [Ash Furrow](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151214/002630.html) noted that he enjoyed having this operator in Ruby. I could go either way here.

Erica Sadun has been on a roll with proposals. üôá She contributed a number of small proposals for some really great syntax refinements. Each of these really help bring an overall consistency to Swift.

* [SE-0031](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0031-adjusting-inout-declarations.md) *Adjusting `inout` Declarations for Type Decoration*, co-authored by Joe Groff. This has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000041.html) for Swift 3. Furthermore, Daniel Duan has already submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1333) to implement this! üëè The main reasons for accepting this include: *"(1) The community and core team both widely agree that it makes sense to move the inout keyword into the type position. (2) This reinforces commonality between the declaration and type syntax. (3) This reduces complexity in the Swift 3 language."*

* [SE-0036](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0036-enum-dot.md) *Requiring Leading Dot Prefixes for Enum Instance Member Implementations*, co-authored by Chris Lattner. Currently, within an `enum` type you can refer to each case with or without the dot prefix (`.`). For example, `.first` versus `first`. This proposal aims to *always* require the `.` for a consistent experience.

* [SE-0034](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0034-disambiguating-line.md), *Disambiguating Line Control Statements from Debugging Identifiers*. This is now under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000040.html). From the introduction: *"The proposal [SE-0028](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0028-modernizing-debug-identifiers.md) overloads the use of `#line` to mean both an identifier that maps to a calling site's line number within a file and acts as part of a line control statement. This proposal nominates `#setline` to replace `#line` for file and line syntactic source control"*.

* [SE-0039](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0039-playgroundliterals.md) *Modernizing Playground Literals*. This proposes the following syntax change to playground literals:

{% highlight swift %}
// Current
[#Color(colorLiteralRed: r, green: g, blue: b, alpha: a)#]

// Proposed
#colorliteral(red: r, green: g, blue: b, alpha: a)
{% endhighlight %}

* The [final proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/159) is *Replacing Equal Signs with Colons For Attribute Arguments*. The current syntax is definitely awkward in the larger picture of Swift. It's easiest to illustrate this with an example:

{% highlight swift %}
// Current
@available(*, unavailable, renamed="MyRenamedProtocol")

// Proposed, using : instead of =
@available(*, unavailable, renamed: "MyRenamedProtocol")
{% endhighlight %}

Joe Groff's proposal, *Limiting `inout` capture to `@noescape` contexts* ([SE-0035](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0035-limit-inout-capture.md)), is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000039.html). From the introduction: *"Swift's behavior when closures capture `inout` parameters and escape their enclosing context is a common source of confusion. We should disallow implicit capture of `inout` parameters except in `@noescape` closures."* This undesired behavior predates the addition of `@noescape`. Dave Abrahams (the original author of the current semantics), Chris Lattner, and Jordan Rose all gave this a [+1](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160125/008105.html).

### Mailing lists

Chris Eidhof [noted](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof/status/700305519328755712) some subtleties when using the new `associatedtype` in Swift 2.2. Good to know! (Not on the mailing lists, but Twitter is close enough, right? üòÅ)

Evan Maloney [started a discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160208/009972.html) around introducing a simplified notation to avoid "the weak/strong dance" with closure capture lists. Feedback was pretty mixed, with the most compelling argument against this being that clients should be required to explicitly check for `nil`.

Dave Abrahams [announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160208/009684.html) that the "InPlace" suffix will be removed from APIs in the standard library, namely SetAlgebra and `Set`. This is the result the continuing refinement of implementation of the [API Guidelines](https://swift.org/blog/swift-api-transformation/). (Also, this full thread is huuuge.)

Speaking of guidelines, Dave also [announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160215/010472.html) that they have been [updated](http://apple.github.io/swift-internals/api-design-guidelines/) to incorporate feedback from the review. üéâ

Jordan Rose [pitched an idea](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160208/009624.html) for overridable members in extensions. *"Today, methods introduced in an extension of a class cannot override or be overridden unless the method is (implicitly or explicitly) marked `@objc`. This proposal lifts the blanket restriction while still enforcing safety."* So far, there's positive support for this.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; compiler crashes are fixed [pretty swiftly these days](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/c83be882be0dee308fbc5993445bb966eee96734). üòé
