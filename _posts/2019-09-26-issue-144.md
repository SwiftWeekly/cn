Full steam ahead: with Swift 5.1 released and the release process for Swift 5.2
outlined, we can look forward to another wave of improvements to the Swift
language coming up.

### Starter task

- [SR-11511](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11511) [Compiler] A returning
value of `Array<Void>` should give a warning, like `Optional<Void>`

### Podcasts

Jesse and JP [discussed the Swift 5.1 release](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/308610)

process](https://swift.org/blog/5-2-release-process/), "a release meant to
include significant quality and performance enhancements."

### Proposals in review

[SE-0264](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0264-stdlib-preview-package.md): *Standard Library Preview Package* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0264-standard-library-preview-package/29068).

> We propose the addition of a new package, `SwiftPreview`, which will form the
initial landing spot for certain additions to the Swift standard library.
>
> Adding this package serves the goal of allowing for rapid adoption of new
standard library features, enabling sooner real-world feedback, and allowing for
an initial period of time where that feedback can lead to source- and
ABI-breaking changes if needed.
>
> As a secondary benefit, it will reduce technical challenges for new community
members implementing new features in the standard library.
>
> In the first iteration, this package will take the following:
>
> - free functions and methods, subscripts, and computed properties via
extensions, that do not require access to the internal implementation of
standard library types and that could reasonably be emitted into the client
> - new types (for example, a sorted dictionary, or useful property wrapper
implementations)
> - new protocols, with conformance of existing library types to those protocols
as appropriate
>
> The package will not include features that need to be matched with language
changes, nor functions that cannot practically be implemented without access to
existing type internals or other non-public features such as LLVM builtins.

### Swift Forums

[Xi Ge](https://twitter.com/xge_apple) pitched [a compiler proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/proposal-emitting-source-information-file-during-compilation/28794)
to emit source information during compilation.

> To enhance the user experience of diagnostics on locally built modules, we
propose emitting an additional file during compilation to keep track of the
source locations of decls (`.sourceinfo` file). Mapping from decl USRs to source
locations in the local file system, the file is always emitted as a side product
of Swift modules into a private sub-directory (`swiftmodule/private`). This
'private' sub-directory will be present in a local build but excluded for
packaging a Swift module for client consumption. A source location is encoded
as an absolute path to the source file and the byte offset inside the source
file.

[James H](https://forums.swift.org/u/jamesgh) asked [about Swift's performance](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-performance/28776) on the server.

> I want to know if there are any plans to effort improving Swift's performance?
Benchmark after benchmark have...pretty dismal... metrics for Swift when
compared to other systems languages.
>
> Now you could make an argument that benchmarks aren't necessarily
representative of real-world use-cases.

> The current Swift implementation is still nowhere near representative of the
performance that should be possible, since we've been primarily in the "make it
work" phase of development, and are only now starting to get into the "make it
fast" work.

[Daryle Walker](https://twitter.com/CTMacUser) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/partial-sorting/28941/7)
to allow for partial sorting in Swift.

> Just cruising the C++ algorithm list and wondered about `std::partial_sort`
and `std::nth_element`.
>
> But I'm still wondering why would these be needed, outside of implementing
other sorting things? Stopping at a point much smaller then the whole collection
doesn't help too much because you still have to scan the whole thing.
>
> Can any of these be implemented stably?

[Elviro Rocca](https://twitter.com/_logicist) asked for [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/whats-the-state-of-modify-yield/29171) on `modify` and `yield`.

> The idea of an `@Atomic` wrapper is also cited as an example in the proposal,
so I thought it could be implemented, but it seems that you can't actually do
that because you cannot ensure that read-write-read processes actually happen
atomically

> [..] atomic anything will require compiler support when not explicitly working
with pointers or global stored properties. Even with `modify`, Swift's formal
model is still move-in/move-out with assumed/enforced exclusivity, not
by-address. (`modify` gets it to move-in/move-out rather than copy-in/copy-out,
but not all the way to by-address. That's still considered an optimization.)
