We're less than a month away from WWDC. While the swift-evolution proposal train seems to finally be slowing down, it seems like the Swift team is just as busy as ever as the end of the Swift 4 release cycle approaches.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-4827](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4827): Incorrect result resolving type for Objective-C block
- [SR-4858](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4858): `IndexPath.hashValue` broken on Linux
- [SR-4824](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4824): Add tests to check Collection constraints are being enforced

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 10: [The Variety Show](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/68158)

This week we discuss multi-line strings, reduce with inout, one-sided ranges, and more!

### News and community

Sommer Panage discusses how to make writing UI code simpler with Swift in her talk, [Writing Your UI Swiftly](https://news.realm.io/news/sommer-panage-writing-your-ui-swiftly/) from [try! Swift Tokyo 2017](https://www.tryswift.co). The video was posted last month, but I've finally got around to watching it! It's really great, I highly recommend it.

Nate Cook also gave a great talk, [Swift's Pointy Bits: Unsafe Swift & Pointer Types](https://news.realm.io/news/nate-cook-tryswift-tokyo-unsafe-swift-and-pointer-types/), at [try! Swift Tokyo 2017](https://www.tryswift.co). Nate explores and explains what "safety" really means in Swift. Again, this video isn't extremely new, but I just watched it this week. Awesome talk.

### Commits and pull requests

Ben Cohen [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9374) `Collection` constraints via protocol where clauses requiring `Indices` and `SubSequence` match the traversal. This resolved 8 ABI FIXMEs!

Robin Kunde [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9070) diagnostic notes and fixits for confusable unicode characters.

John McCall [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9431) refinements to dynamic exclusivity, continuing work outlined in the [Ownership Manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/OwnershipManifesto.md).

Michael Ilseman [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9265) support for Unicode 9 grapheme breaking (i.e. emoji). Whatever that means. ðŸ˜†

Jordan Rose opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9401) to make all CoreFoundation types conform to `Equatable` and `Hashable` using `CFHash` and `CFEqual` as the implementation. This will be available in Swift 4, even when using "Swift 3 mode".

Erik Eckstein [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9353) changes to allow `Character` literals that fit into 64 bits, be folded into a single integer constant. It makes character literals much faster (3x improvement for the CharacterLiteralsSmall benchmark) and it removes a lot of redundant code (~80% for the CharacterLiteralsSmall benchmark).

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0174](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0174-filter-range-replaceable.md): *Change `filter` to return an associated type* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-May/000374.html).

> The proposal is accepted. Thank you to everyone who participated in the review!

[SE-0175](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0175-package-manager-revised-dependency-resolution.md): *Package Manager Revised Dependency Resolution* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-May/000375.html).

> The proposal is accepted for Swift 4. Thank you to everyone who participated in the review!

### Mailing lists

Ben Cohen [pitched a draft proposal](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170508/036582.html) to add a `unicodeScalar` view to `Character`, similar to that on `String`.

> The `Character` element type of `String` is currently a black box that provides little functionality besides comparison, literal construction, and to be used as an argument to `String.init`.
>
> Many operations on String could be neatly/readily implemented as operations on each character in the string, if `Character` exposed its scalars more directly. Many useful things can be determined by examining the scalars in a grapheme (for example is this an ASCII character?).
