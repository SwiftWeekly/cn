September is here, and we're closing out the Summer of Swift. We’ve almost made it through the beta period and now iOS 12, macOS Mojave, Xcode 10, and Swift 4.2 are upon us.

There’s been a flurry of activity on Swift Evolution and around the community; let’s get started with all the latest!

### News and community

The LLVM Foundation [announced the program for the 2018 LLVM Developers' Meeting](http://blog.llvm.org/2018/08/announcing-program-for-2018-llvm.html) scheduled for October 17–18 in San Jose. Swift nerds will [recognize](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/talk-abstracts.html#talk15) several [names](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/talk-abstracts.html#talk13) on the [program](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/talk-abstracts.html#talk12).

The [Swift Server Work Group](https://swift.org/server/) has a new stated goal:

> The main goal of the Swift Server work group is to eventually recommend libraries and tools for server application development with Swift.

[SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) is currently the sole recommended library, but you can stay on top of updates from the group in the [Server category of the Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/development/server).


### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://github.com/DougGregor) merged in some new ["Request-Evaluator" infrastructure](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/1032774695039324160) around the type checker to help eliminate mutable state and track dependencies. See the [design document](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/RequestEvaluator.md) and [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/18923) for all the details.

[Erik Eckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein) removed the now unneeded [pinning built-ins and SIL instructions](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/18922). As [summarized in a tweet](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/1032871154032111616): "Nice simplification of the Swift reference counting model - the entire concept of “pinning” is gone now, thanks to exclusivity enforcement".

Great work by [Pavol Vaskovic](https://bugs.swift.org/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=palimondo) on spotting a recent regression [causing incorrect sorting](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8682) (!) from the standard library, and [Kirill Chibisov](https://github.com/overlazy) for [the bug fix](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/19107). Test your code and watch your variable names!


### Accepted proposals

[SE-0200](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0200-raw-string-escaping.md): _Enhancing String Literals Delimiters to Support Raw Text_ [was accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0200-enhancing-string-literals-delimiters-to-support-raw-text/15822/1). With extra delimiting characters `#"like this"#`, you’ll be able to control how escaping works and have an easier time writing "raw" text.

This is one of the most well written Swift Evolution proposals in my opinion, and has an epic **461** [forum posts](https://forums.swift.org/t/pure-bikeshedding-raw-strings-why-yes-again/13866) split [across](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0200-raw-mode-string-literals/11048) three [threads](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0200-enhancing-string-literals-delimiters-to-support-raw-text/15420) for your reading pleasure.

[SE-0225](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0225-binaryinteger-iseven-isodd-ismultiple.md): _Adding `isMultiple` to `BinaryInteger`_ [was accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0225-adding-ismultiple-to-binaryinteger/15689). The `isMultiple(of:)` method made it in, but proposed computed properties `isEven` and `isOdd` were dropped.

[SE-0226](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0226-package-manager-target-based-dep-resolution.md): _Package Manager Target Based Dependency Resolution_
was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0226-package-manager-target-based-dependency-resolution/15404/16) with generally positive comments all around. This change will speed up package resolution by only resolving dependencies that are actually used rather than all declared dependencies.


### Returned proposals

[SE-0223](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0223-array-uninitialized-initializer.md): _Accessing an Array's Uninitialized Buffer_ [was returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0223-accessing-an-arrays-uninitialized-buffer/15194/40). This proposal would allow you to initialize and access arrays via raw buffer. The core team was looking for more usage experience and discussion around handling errors.


### Rejected proposals

[SE-0132](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0132-sequence-end-ops.md): _Rationalizing Sequence end-operation names_ [was rejected](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/898). Although it would make sequence and collection operation naming more consistent (e.g. "first" vs "start" vs "prefix"), the core team decided the source compatibility hit would be too great.

[SE-0222](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0222-lazy-compactmap-sequence.md): _Lazy CompactMap Sequence_ [was rejected](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0222-lazy-compactmap-sequence/14850/16). The proposal would have added a new `LazyCompactMapCollection` to represent a `compactMap` to more efficiently handle chains of `map` and `filter` operations.

The core team decided the performance benefits were negligible and not worth the increased complexity pointed out during the review discussion.


### Proposals in review

[SE-0227](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0227-identity-keypath.md): _Identity key path_ [is in review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0227-identity-key-path/15830) through Friday September 14.

Swift values already have a `.self` pseudo-property to refer to the value itself, and this proposal would add a corresponding key path `\.self`.


### Swift Forums

Containerization has officially reached the world of Swift: Haris Amin posted about plans to offer [an official Docker image](https://forums.swift.org/t/kickstarting-new-official-docker-support-for-swift/15487) for the community.

[Doug Gregor](https://forums.swift.org/u/Douglas_Gregor) wrote a pitch for [Opaque result types](https://forums.swift.org/t/opaque-result-types/15645) — the ability to hide a function’s exact return type and specify its capabilities instead.

[Erik Eckstein](https://forums.swift.org/u/Erik_Eckstein) wrote an update on [improvements to running benchmarks on pull requests](https://forums.swift.org/t/improved-benchmarking-for-pull-requests/15461). They are faster, less noisy, and have nicer reports — a great boost to developer productivity.

[Alex Hoppen](https://forums.swift.org/u/ahoppen) announced [SwiftSyntax is now in its own repository](https://forums.swift.org/t/swiftsyntax-is-now-a-swiftpm-project/15691) and available to include via Swift Package Manager. [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax) is a wrapper for [libSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/lib/Syntax) and lets you write tools to work with Swift code in Swift.

[Daniel Duan highlighted](https://twitter.com/daniel_duan/status/1035331454467796993) the [approval post for SE-0225](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0225-adding-ismultiple-to-binaryinteger/15689) mentioned above, where review manager [John McCall](https://forums.swift.org/u/John_McCall) listed guidelines for what gets included in the standard library:

> To be considered for addition to the library, a proposed feature must satisfy two conditions: it must provide functionality that is useful to a substantial population of Swift programmers, and it must provide substantial advantages over the alternative ways of accomplishing that functionality.


### Finally

Add this to the category of things I read all the time, but never had to say out loud and [don't know how to pronounce](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/1035568097535508480).
