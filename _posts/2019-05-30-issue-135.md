T-4 days for WWDC 2019! Oh yes, if somehow you missed that, it will start
after the weekend. Looking forward to everything that's new, including potential
news about the future of Swift... fingers crossed!

For those that are attending, have an awesome time! _And_ also make sure to say
hello to [Kristaps](https://twitter.com/fassko)... he might have Swift Weekly
Brief [stickers](https://twitter.com/swiftlybrief/status/1133353935895445504)
to give out. Make sure to share pictures of where you put those :-)

Also, and I missed to include this two weeks ago,
[John McCall](https://twitter.com/pathofshrines) shared
[something I wanted to point out](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0258-property-delegates/24080)
to all of you reading, and in particular, those directly involved with the Swift
evolution process:

> I'd like to thank the community for its patience and its commitment. I know
we've had a lot of proposals recently, and some of them have been contentious,
and it can be a lot of work to keep up with Swift Evolution. You really are
appreciated; thank you for everything you do to help make Swift a better
language.

Well said.

### Starter task

- [TF-449](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-449) [Standard Library]
Conditionally conform `Optional` to `Differentiable`

### News and community

[Laurence Moroney](https://twitter.com/lmoroney) and [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm)
talked [about how Swift has grown beyond mobile development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5M4otA4S3A).

[Will Lisac](https://twitter.com/wlisac) open sourced [a set of Docker images](https://github.com/wlisac/swift-on-balena)

### Commits and pull requests

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25030)
using the runtime hook mechanism to backward deploy [a bug fix](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-10600).

[Erik Eckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24929)
allowing Swift’s optimizer to constant fold key path accesses down into direct
field accesses!

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0260](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0260-library-evolution.md): *Library Evolution for Stable ABIs* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0260-library-evolution-for-stable-abis/24845).

> Stable library evolution has been a goal of the Swift project since its
earliest days. SE-0260 builds on years of design and implementation effort,
and it is as much an announcement of the success of that work as it is a
proposal to change the language. Most of the formal content of the proposal is
carved deep into the bones of the language; it could not be made any other way
without grave consequences. All of this is to say that the basic outcome of
this review is at least a little preordained.
>
> Still, there are details that are worth debating. There were two basic
categories of discussion in the review:
>
> - Several reviewers provided concrete feedback on specific aspects of the
new attributes and compilation modes proposed by SE-0260. On balance, the Core
Team is satisfied with the language rules and names as proposed.
>
> - There was quite a lot of debate about the exact process of developing and
evolving stable libraries and the exact guarantees that Swift is making here.
While SE-0260 lays out the most basic rules for stable libraries, there are
many details like these that remain unsettled and which may have significant
consequences for the evolution of the implementation. The Core Team feels that
these details can be worked out in later proposals, and that any limitations on
the implementation will provide adequate incentive to ensure that they are.

[SE-0253](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0253-callable.md): *Callable values of user-defined nominal types* was [accepted with modification](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modification-se-0253-callable-values-of-user-defined-nominal-types/24605).

> [..] the core team decided to accept the proposal, with the request to change
`func call()` syntax to `func callFunction()`. The core team chose this
direction because it retains the 'call' nomenclature established by
[SE-0216](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0216-dynamic-callable.md),
but is a more verbose name that is less likely to already exist, or be
accidentally used for an unrelated purpose.

After more feedback from the community, it was then [further revised](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modification-se-0253-callable-values-of-user-defined-nominal-types/24605/166).

> The Core Team discussed this and has decided to **further revise the
proposal** to name the operator function `func callAsFunction()`. We are
comfortable with enabling this functionality purely based on nothing more than
the name of a function, and we are not persuaded that `init` and `subscript`
(which both have substantially different semantic and syntactic rules and are
not simply functions) provide important precedents here requiring a new
declaration introducer.

### Swift Forums

[Pavol Vaskovic](https://twitter.com/palimondo) shared [an update on benchmark performance](https://forums.swift.org/t/towards-robust-performance-measurement/11490/26).

> I’m happy to announce that by the beginning of March 2018, [a series of pull
requests](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Amerged+is%3Apr+author%3Apalimondo+Janitor)
that applied **legacy factor** across the whole Swift Benchmark Suite (SBS) has
lowered the workloads of individual benchmarks to execute in the 20–1000 μs
range. My thanks go to [Erik Eckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein) for his
patient review and guidance.
>
> Point of this modification was to strengthen the resilience of our measurement
process against accumulated errors caused by context switches that happen every
10 ms on macOS.

[Dale Buckley](https://twitter.com/Dale_Buckley) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pre-pitch-removeall-at/24820)
that introduces a `removeAll(at:)` function.

> When dealing with collections of data, there are often times where it is
required to remove multiple elements from a collection at different indices
within the same operation. There are some common mistakes that can lead to
unperformant and buggy code when presented with this task. This proposal intends
to provide a simplified method to perform this operation in a safe and
performant way.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) shared [a revised pitch](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-3-property-wrappers-formerly-known-as-property-delegates/24961)
for property wrappers.

> I've revised the property delegates proposal again, albeit under a more
descriptive name ["property wrappers"](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/property-wrappers/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md).
>
> - The name of the feature has been changed from "property delegates" to
"property wrappers" to better communicate how they work and avoid the existing
uses of the term "delegate" in the Apple developer community
>
> - When a property wrapper type has a no-parameter `init()`, properties that
use that wrapper type will be implicitly initialized via `init()`.
>
> - Support for property wrapper composition has been added, using a "nesting"
model.
>
> - A property with a wrapper can no longer have an explicit get or set
declared, to match with the behavior of existing, similar features
(`lazy`, `@NSCopying`).
>
> - A property with a wrapper does not need to be `final`.
>
> - Reduced the visibility of the synthesized storage property to `private`,
and expanded upon potential future directions to making it more visible.
>
> - Removed the restriction banning property wrappers from having names that
match the regular expression `_*[a-z].*.`
>
> - `Codable`, `Hashable`, and `Equatable` synthesis are now based on the
backing storage properties, which is a simpler model that gives more control
to the authors of property wrapper types.

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) announced [Swift support in CMake](https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-swift-support-in-cmake/24792/1)!

> I have been working with upstream to integrate Swift support into CMake with
the Ninja generator so that it can be integrated into existing projects much
more conveniently. I would like to announce that the last of the initial set of
changes needed to support Swift in CMake have been merged now into CMake and I
expect that the next major release of CMake (3.15) to include the Swift support.

... as well as [Swift REPL on Windows](https://forums.swift.org/t/comming-soon-to-a-terminal-near-you-swift-repl-on-windows/24917)!

> I have gotten the REPL to the point where it now runs on Windows! There are
some improvements to be made still, primarily in the application of Data
Formatters. However, the expression evaluation appears to work now and overall.
If there are people who would like to get involved in the Windows port on the
lldb side - this provides an excellent opportunity to delve into lldb. It also
can expand easily into the compiler side if you start looking at the AST side
of things.
