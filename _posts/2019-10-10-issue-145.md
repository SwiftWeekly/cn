I've had a great week in Paris, attending and giving a workshop at FrenchKit.
I hope you've all had a great week too!

I also wanted to mention that this month is [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com),
a yearly, month-long celebration of open source software. A perfect time to
contribute to (Swift) open source!

And with that, here's what's been cookin' in the last two weeks in terms of
Swift.org and other Apple open source projects.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-11574](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11574) [Compiler] Using `try`
instead of `throws` should have a better diagnostic
- [SR-11580](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11580) [SwiftSyntax]
`FloatLiteralExprSyntax` and `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax` should have comuted
properties that return their `Int`/`Float` value
- [SR-11588](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11588) [Compiler] Warn about
derived `Hashable` implementation if there's a custom `Equatable`

### Podcasts

Jesse and JP [discussed](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/309982) the Standard Library Preview Package.

### Commits and pull requests

[Bruno Rocha](https://twitter.com/rockthebruno) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/pull/163)
adding support for local refactoring of Swift code in SourceKit-LSP!

[Zoe Carver](https://github.com/zoecarver) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27551)
with optimizations for Swift that enables constant-folding of string comparisons.

[Harlan Haskins](http://twitter.com/harlanhaskins) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/20420)
that adds an experimental flag to skip non-inlinable function bodies and turns
it on for the standard library and overlay `.swiftmodules`.

> If you’re working on a build system and you’re implementing the
"`-emit-module` first, then build" optimization, try adding
`-Xfrontend -experimental-skip-non-inlinable-function-bodies`.

### Returned proposals

[SE-0263](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0263-string-uninitialized-initializer.md): *Add a String Initializer with Access to Uninitialized Storage* was [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0263-review-2-add-a-string-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-storage/29663).

> This proposal suggests a new initializer for `String` that provides access
to a String's uninitialized storage buffer.
>
> `String` today is well-suited to interoperability with raw memory buffers
when a contiguous buffer is already available, such as when dealing with
`malloc`ed C strings. However, there are quite a few situations where no such
buffer is available, requiring a temporary one to be allocated and copied into.
One example is bridging `NSString` to `String`, which currently uses standard
library internals to get good performance when using `CFStringGetBytes`.
Another, also from the standard library, is `Int` and `Float`, which currently
create temporary stack buffers and do extra copying. We expect libraries like
SwiftNIO will also find this useful for dealing with streaming data.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0265](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0265-offset-indexing-and-slicing.md): *Offset-Based Access to Indices, Elements, and Slices* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0265-offset-based-access-to-indices-elements-and-slices/29596).

> This proposal introduces `OffsetBound`, which can represent a position in a
collection specified as an offset from either the beginning or end of the
collection (i.e. the collection’s “bounds”). Corresponding APIs provide a more
convenient abstraction over indices. The goal is to alleviate an expressivity
gap in collection APIs by providing easy and safe means to access elements,
indices, and slices from such offsets.

[SE-0266](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0266-synthesized-comparable-for-enumerations.md): *Synthesized `Comparable` conformance for `enum` types* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0266-synthesized-comparable-conformance-for-enum-types/29457).

> [SE-185](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0185-synthesize-equatable-hashable.md)
introduced synthesized, opt-in `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformances for
eligible types. Their sibling protocol `Comparable` was left out at the time,
since it was less obvious what types ought to be eligible for a synthesized
`Comparable` conformance and where a comparison order might be derived from.
This proposal seeks to allow users to opt-in to synthesized `Comparable`
conformances for `enum` types without raw values or associated values not
themselves conforming to `Comparable`, a class of types which I believe make
excellent candidates for this feature. The synthesized comparison order would be
based on the declaration order of the `enum` cases, and then the lexicographic
comparison order of the associated values for an `enum` case tie.

### Swift Forums

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) announced [a Swift compiler driver
reimplementation in Swift](https://forums.swift.org/t/new-project-announcement-swift-compiler-driver-reimplementation-in-swift/29696)!

> [The swift-driver project](https://github.com/apple/swift-driver) is a new
implementation of the Swift compiler driver that is intended to replace the
existing driver with a more extensible, maintainable, and robust code base. The
Swift compiler’s driver is what handles the build of a Swift module: it runs the
Swift compiler frontend to compile source code to object files, the linker to
link those object files into a library or executable, and so on, and contains
much of the knowledge of how to produce working programs for any given platform.
The driver is the main program that build systems (e.g. SwiftPM, `xcodebuild`,
`make`, `ninja`) interact with to compile Swift code, so it is a key piece of
infrastructure for building Swift code. The new swift-driver is architected as a
Swift library, allowing for deeper integration with the Swift Package Manager.

[Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/ilseman/) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/prototype-protocol-powered-generic-trimming-searching-splitting/29415)
for protocol-powered generic trimming, searching, and splitting Collections.

> This prototype demonstrates two main protocols, `CollectionConsumer` and
`CollectionSearcher`, and a suite of API generic over them.
>
> Native regex literals will be built on top of generic functionality and used
with generic APIs. These can be broken down into 4 stages:
>
> 1. Consumers: nibbling off the front or back of a Collection
> 2. Searchers: finding a needle in a haystack (i.e. a Collection)
> 3. Validators: constructing types in the process of consuming/searching
> 4. [Destructuring Pattern Matching Syntax](https://gist.github.com/milseman/bb39ef7f170641ae52c13600a512782f#syntax-for-destructing-matching):
Like `~=`, but can bind a value
>
> Each stage delivers important API and syntax improvements to users alongside
powerful extension points for libraries. Native regex literals would conform to
these protocols and leverage new syntax, allowing them to be used by the same
generic APIs.
>
> This prototype covers stages 1 and 2.

[Jon Gilbert](https://forums.swift.org/u/vitamin/summary) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/compositional-initialization/29535)
to add support for Compositional Initalization.

> This proposal introduces an opt-in protocol, PropertyInitializable, which provides two new init methods:
>
> - failable init from a collections of extensible, typesafe keypath-value
Property objects
> - non-failable init to clone from another instance, mutating select properties
>
> The name “compositional init” means that this proposal allows the state of an
object or struct to be assembled compositionally from sets of properties
(including another instance). Compositional initialization allows mutations to
be encapsulated in a clear, type-safe way.

[Gustaf Kugelberg](https://forums.swift.org/u/greatape/summary) pitched [a
proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/expressiblebytupleliteral-instead-of-tuples-conforming-to-protocols/29626)
to introduce `ExpressibleByTupleLiteral` instead of tuples conforming to
protocols.

> As can be seen from the forum history, many people have suggested ways to
make it possible to conform tuple types to protocols. It is perhaps most natural
when the conformance can be synthesized, - in my personal usage it's certainly
conformance to `Equatable` and `Hashable` that I've wanted to confer on my tuple
typed keys.
