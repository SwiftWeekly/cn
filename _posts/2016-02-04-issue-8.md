This week an [official blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-ci/) on Swift.org announced the new continuous integration setup that I mentioned last week. There is now a [dedicated page](https://swift.org/continuous-integration/) on the main site and you can check the status [here](https://ci.swift.org). It seems to be nicely [integrated](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/693069527807041536) with GitHub, and [mostly works](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1151#issuecomment-178211302). 😄

### Commits and pull requests

Erik Eckstein [committed](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/aaaf36e83521f153ba4b0720795efe4980d9b124) some [impressive](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/693190676666675200) whole module optimization performance improvements. 😎

David Farler [added support](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/e87be804c9d8111012555263aa86021ab1735ccf) for writing code block comments in any language.

William Dillon followed up on some [previous Linux/ARMv7](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/608) work, this time [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1157) that adds support for gold linker. This change aims to solve issues on ARMv6/v7 and aarch64 platforms.

Harlan Haskins [merged a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1122) that adds backtrace reporting on `fatalError`. 👏

C.W. Betts [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/251) `NSUserDefaults` in corelibs-foundation.

Slava Pestov [started](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1182) on adding support for resiliently adding protocol requirements with default implementations.

Doug Gregor [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1185) code completion improvements for `#selector`.

### Proposals

Joe Groff and Erica Sadun [submitted a proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/128/files), *"Adjusting `inout` Declarations for Type Decoration"*. They suggest moving the `inout` keyword from the label side to the type side in a function declaration to clarify that this decorates types and avoid confusion with similarly named argument labels.

Nate Cook [has proposed](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/125) to *"Add sequence-based initializers and merge methods to Dictionary"*.

>The `Dictionary` type should allow initialization from a sequence of `(Key, Value)` tuples and offer methods that merge a sequence of `(Key, Value)` tuples with an existing dictionary.

The proposal, *"Modernizing Swift's Debugging Identifiers"*, ([SE-0028](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0028-modernizing-debug-identifiers.md)) has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000030.html)! 👏

The review for proposals [SE-0005](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0005-objective-c-name-translation.md), [SE-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0006-apply-api-guidelines-to-the-standard-library.md), [SE-0023](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0023-api-guidelines.md) has been [extended](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-January/000029.html) until February 5. If you have opinions on the [great Swift API transformation](https://swift.org/blog/swift-api-transformation/), speak now!

### Mailing lists

Justin Kolb started [a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160125/007984.html) for proposing support for contiguous variables.

>To better support interfacing with lower level systems, like graphics
libraries for example, it would be helpful to support the concept of
contiguous variables.

Ted Kremenek [announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-lldb-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160201/000043.html) that the Swift 2.2 branch is now under restrictive change control, meaning any changes going in to `swift-2.2-branch` will require specific approval from the release manager.

Gwendal Roué started [a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160125/008167.html) about guaranteed closure execution.

As expected, the [swift-evolution](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/) mailing list has been super busy with the discussion of the three proposals mentioned above (SE-0005, SE-0006, SE-0023). There is definitely too much to try to summarize or link to here. If you have a minute to read through the archives, you should!

Related to this review, Dave Abrahams started an [exploratory thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160201/008838.html), *"When to use argument labels (a new approach)"*.

Chris Lattner [revealed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160201/009015.html) that at one point the Swift team briefly discussed using `‽` (the [interrobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang)) as the sugar for `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional`. 🤓

### Finally

And finally &mdash; has Bjarne ever [made the mistake](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1183#commitcomment-15864521) of forgetting the `~` for C++ destructors? Jacob Bandes-Storch [saved the day](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/694988732718448642) with this massive [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1183/files). 😂
